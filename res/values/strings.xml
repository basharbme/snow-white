    <string name="help_title_1">1. What is this App for?</string>
    <string name="help_1">To begin with the App needs a photo of a face. The App detects the face and the facial features automatically and calculates a beauty score. The score relies on the golden ratio, as well as the symmetry of the facial features. A face is notably beautifull, if the face matches the optimal proportions of the golden ratio (1: 1,618) and is symmetrical.</string>
    <string name="help_title_2">2. Correct way to take a photo</string>
    <string name="help_2">The face needs to be recorded frontal without any tilt. The person should keep a neutral face expression - do not frown, do not smile. Just that way the App works correct and reveals something about the beauty of the face.</string>
    <string name="help_title_3">3. The App crashes!</string>
    <string name="help_3">Most likely the App needs more processing power than your device offers. Under Settings you have the possibility to reduce the size of the images.</string>
